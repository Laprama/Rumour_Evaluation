# RumourEval

## Notes

1. Clone the repo
2. Create a conda environment using `environment.yml` (may not be neccessary, not using anything special so should work anyway)
3. The scripts for data extraction are in `data_extraction`
4. If you `cd data_extraction` then `python twitter_data_extraction.py` will work but wont output anything (if you want to play with the training data then import the module into a shell (as commented in `twitter_data_extraction.py`, see main).
5. The `data` directory contains all the raw data if you want to explore.
6. Link to the task is [here](https://www.aclweb.org/anthology/S19-2147/)
